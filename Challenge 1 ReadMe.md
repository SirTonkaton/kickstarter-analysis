# Kickstarter_Analysis

## Overview of Project

As individuals look into the releasing of a play, there are factors such as the month of release and the funding goal that will have a direct impact on its success. This project will provide tables and graphs that will help visualize trends plays seem to have based on thier Launch Date and their Outcome Based on Goals to help the user better understand the information and maximize their investment.   

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

#### Successful Plays
The best months to release a play and have a better chance for it to be successful are May and June. On the table below, both months show at least a 65% chance of success.

#### Failed Plays
While each month shows that at least 30% of the plays from the list provided failed, October and December show a 43% and 46% chance of failure respectively.

#### Canceled Plays
The percentage of canceled plays is relatively low compared to the amount of plays released throughout the months of each year. However, releasing a play in the month of January could represent at least a 7% chance the play will be canceled.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

#### Successful Plays
When the funding goal remains under $5,000, the success rate seems to be at least 73%.

#### Failed Plays
As the goal amount increases, the number of plays starts to decrease significantly. The range of $5,000 - $25,000 represents the biggest sample after the $4,999 goal is met. At the same time the chances of a play failing remains above 45% for the most part, which in my opinion is high risk.

#### Canceled Plays
With the information provided, there is no data available that shows risk for a play to be canceled based on the plays' funding goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

#### Table Connection Challenge
The two tables of information do not provide a connection between them in regards the "Cancelation" factor. While we can see that cancelations occur throughout the year, the goal range does not provide any cancelations based on the ranges examined.

#### Reasons for failed plays
There are multiple factors that will result on a failed play. We are limited to just take into account the funding goal and time of release. The more variables we know, the better we can filter the information to present visual aid for decision making.

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The months of May, June and July are when more plays are released.
2. There is almost a 50% chance that releasing a play in the month of December will result on failure.

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. Funding goal for a play should be on the $1 - $4,999 range as that will maximize its rate of success.

## Comments

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
It would be interesting to know the advertising method each play used before launch date. There are other variables that could help explain the reason for failure.

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A table filtering the information by country and genre could help identify outliers to pinpoint the interest of the viewers per area.
